# Abstract
The study used supervised and unsupervised machine learning models for predicting healthy control and non-healthy controls using AIBL lifestyle data. Supervised models of Na√Øve Bayes, XGBoost Model, Decision Tree Model, and Random Tree Forest were used for prediction and the analysis showed that Random Forest Model was the best predictor showing 93% accuracy while Hierarchical clustering, K Means Clustering, Dimensionality reduction using PCA were the unsupervised learning models. The study showed that the unsupervised models are not suitable for this kind of data as the data is curated for supervised learning.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111323269/192747307-f385cc40-721f-4e26-b583-8227a4317ba0.png)
